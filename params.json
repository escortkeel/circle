It fundamentally aims to be lightweight and easy to use.\r\n\r\nThe project was started on March 27 2013.\r\n\r\nThe source code is hosted on <a href=\"https://github.com/escortkeel/cIRCle\">GitHub</a> and is released under the terms of the <a href=\"https://raw.github.com/escortkeel/cIRCle/master/LICENSE\">Simplified BSD License</a>.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nComing soon.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nThe following code connects to the \"irc.freenode.net\" IRC network with the nickname \"cIRCler\" and joins channel #botwar. It will send the message \"Hi!\" all members of #botwar, before quitting with the message \"Bye!\".\r\n```java\r\nimport com.github.escortkeel.circle.IRCClient;\r\nimport com.github.escortkeel.circle.IRCAdapter;\r\nimport com.github.escortkeel.circle.event.IRCChannelJoinEvent;\r\nimport java.io.IOException;\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {\r\n        IRCClient c = new IRCClient(\"cIRCler\", new IRCAdapter() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void onChannelJoin(IRCChannelJoinEvent e) {\r\n                e.getClient().privmsg(e.getChannel(), \"Hi!\");\r\n                e.getClient().quit(\"Bye!\");\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n        c.connect(\"irc.freenode.net\");\r\n        c.join(\"#botwar\");\r\n        c.waitFor();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-39697750-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
